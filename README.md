This package has Python bindings which target Python 2.7.  You can also use it as a C++ library.

In Python code, `import s2`.

## Dependencies

You'll need the development (-dev or -devel) versions of these libraries in order to build the library.

- OpenSSL (used for [BIGNUM](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/crypto/bn.html) functions)

You'll need these build-time dependencies:

- SCons
- SWIG (must be `swig` in your PATH)

A C++ compiler supporting C++11 (g++ 4.8 or later, clang 3.3 or later) is also required.

### Mac OS X specific notes

Make sure you are using python.org Python, and that it is the default in your path (not Apple's Python or Macports Python).

Install `scons` using `easy_install`, not MacPorts.

Other dependencies will need to be installed with MacPorts using the `+universal` build flag.

Make sure `/opt/local/bin` and `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin` are not only listed in `$PATH`, but also in `/etc/paths` before `/usr/bin` (otherwise Python bindings will fail to build).

## Building
### The Linux From Scratch way (also for OSX)

```console
scons
sudo scons install
```

This will also build the Python bindings.

You can uninstall the library with `sudo scons install -c`.

### As a Debian package

This is currently broken, and needs to be ported to scons.

```console
apt-get install python-dev debhelper libgflags-dev cdbs swig build-essential fakeroot autoconf libtool pkg-config
./autogen.sh
pushd ..
tar jcf s2_1.0.0.orig.tar.bz2 s2-geometry-library/ --exclude=.git
popd
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
```

## Installing the Debian package

Once built:

```console
dpkg -i ../libs2*.deb ../python-s2*.deb
```

## Running the tests (Python)

```console
python test.py
```
